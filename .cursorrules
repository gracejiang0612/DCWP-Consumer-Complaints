 Key Guidelines:
Typography Hierarchy

Headline: Use a classic serif font (e.g., NYTCheltenham) at a moderate size; avoid excessive boldness.

Subhead/Deck: Light or regular weight, smaller size, gray-toned (e.g., #444), offering graceful support.

Bylines and datelines: Smaller sans-serif, in muted grayscale (e.g., #888), aligned left.

Layout and Spacing

Generous white space around headlines and images. Let the story breathe.

Maintain one-column or tight two-column layout to mirror print-like aesthetics for gravitas.

Color Palette

Stick to a monochrome or grayscale scheme, reserving color for:

Hyperlinks (#1a0dab)

Hover states (#c0392b)

Feature tags (e.g., "Dance", "Theater") in muted tones (#666 or #999)

Image Use

Use one strong hero image, full-width, with centered caption in smaller serif italic (if needed).

No border or drop shadowâ€”images should feel embedded, not elevated.
